## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### ❔ Does this plugin work with all WooCommerce themes?

This plugin targets the **default HTML structure** of WooCommerce attribute filter widgets. While it works with most themes, **highly customized themes** may require **minor CSS adjustments**.

### ❔ Does it support AJAX filtering?

The plugin adds **client-side filtering** to the attribute list only (within the widget).  
The actual **product filtering still works as usual**, and may use AJAX if supported by your theme or other plugins.
